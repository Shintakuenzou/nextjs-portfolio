# Portfolio em Next.js
This is a portfolio project developed with Next.js framework. The aim is to present relevant professional information, projects, skills and experiences. Using Next.js 13, we seek to explore the framework's latest features to improve user experience and development efficiency. Together, we use Framer Motion to easily and declaratively add animations, making the user experience more immersive and interactive.

## Functionalities
The portfolio has the following pages:
### Home
The portfolio homepage is designed to provide quick and accessible information to visitors. Contains a photo of the author, a brief description that highlights his main areas of expertise and a section dedicated to projects. Each project is presented as an accessible link, allowing visitors to click through to more information about each individual project. In addition, the page also includes links to the author's social networks, facilitating the connection and interaction with the public. This approach allows the visitor to have an overview of the author's work and access more details about specific projects, providing an intuitive and enriching browsing experience.
### Blog
A section dedicated to articles or posts related to the person's work. It is an opportunity to share knowledge, experiences, tips or any other relevant content. Each post can contain a title, a brief description, publication date and can be accessed for full reading.
### About
A timeline-style page that presents the career path of the person behind the portfolio. It's a visually appealing way to highlight important experiences, achievements, and milestones over time. Each event on the timeline can have a title, description and associated date.
### Contact
The page features a button that directs visitors to get in touch by email. The button is an open invitation for visitors to send messages, whether for job opportunities, partnerships or simply to exchange experiences and establish professional connections. Clicking the button will take you to a new email window, allowing visitors to conveniently and directly initiate a conversation with the portfolio author.
